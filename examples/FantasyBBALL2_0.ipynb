You lack clear strength in any of the 8 head-to-head categories, except when your players are fully healthy, which has not been the case.\n",
            "*   **Opponent's Strengths:** They have a strong all-around team with scoring threats in Tatum, DeRozan, and Towns, plus playmaking from VanVleet and Williams (when healthy), with rebounding from Davis, Zubac, and Claxton. They are fairly well-rounded, with good depth.\n",

            "    *   **Why:** With the Suns starting Plumlee over Nurkic and Ayton missing time with injuries, you can sell high on their potential and target someone who will provide value immediately.\n",

            "    *    **Cole Anthony (ORL):** Consistent role player who fills the stat sheet and is a good scorer.\n",
